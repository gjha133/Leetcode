Implementation
​
Naive Approach
Time Complexity = O(N), Space Complexity = O(H) where H is the height of the Binary Tree
```
class Solution {
public:
int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
if(root == NULL) return 0;
else return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
}
};
​
```
Efficient Approach
Time Complexity = O(Log(n)^2), Space Complexity = O(H) where H is the height of the Binary Tree
​
```
class Solution {
public:
int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
int leftHeight = 0, rightHeight = 0;
TreeNode *cur = root;
while(cur != NULL){
leftHeight++;
cur = cur->left;
}
cur = root;
while(cur != NULL){
rightHeight++;
cur = cur->right;
}
if(leftHeight == rightHeight) return pow(2, leftHeight) - 1;
return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
}
};
